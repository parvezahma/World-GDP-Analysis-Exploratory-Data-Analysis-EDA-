📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the World GDP dataset, aimed at uncovering global economic patterns, trends, and disparities across countries and over time.

🎯 Objectives

Understand the structure and quality of the World GDP dataset

Analyze global and country-level GDP trends over time

Identify top-performing economies and economic concentration

Visualize GDP distributions and growth patterns

🗂️ Dataset Description

Source: Publicly available World GDP dataset

Granularity: Country-wise GDP values across multiple years

Key Features:

Country

Year

GDP (numeric, currency-based)

The raw dataset is preserved for transparency, and a cleaned version is generated as part of the analysis.


Key Insights

Global GDP demonstrates a long-term upward trend with identifiable periods of slowdown.

A small group of countries contributes a disproportionately large share of total global GDP.

GDP values are highly right-skewed, reflecting global economic inequality.

Emerging economies show accelerating growth patterns in recent decades.

These insights are exploratory in nature and intended to guide further economic modeling or forecasting.
